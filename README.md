Hello everyone!

This project is the final assigment for class ECE 547, at University of Arizona. In this assignment, I am supposed to design and implement a high-level synthesis tool capable of creating a synthesizable high-level state machine (HLSM) description in Verilog from a C-like sequential program supporting conditional and loop constructs while providing various scheduling algorithms.

Test files and command line arguments can be found in following webpage:
http://www2.engr.arizona.edu/~ece474a/Main/Assignment4

Since this project is developed based on previous code of Assignment 1,2,3, more functions are just added in schedule.cpp. In real practice, however, functions in schedule.cpp should be divided into 3 files, one for files parsing, one for schedulerï¼Œ one for verilog files generation, so that code can be more readable. Sorry for your inconvenience when reading my code.

If you have any question, please let me know.

NOTE: DO NOT copy these files, and submit them as your own work. Professor will find that out.
